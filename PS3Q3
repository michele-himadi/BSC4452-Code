#**a note about the if wtr_chng < 0.64 line**
    #if there isn't a max value, wtr_avgmax will continue printing 0.64 and the data will be offset to the last date
    #ideally I would've configured a way to stop the function once a max value has been reached
    #however that was a little out of my scope of Python knowledge, but I did write "wtr_maxlimit.append(wtr_avgmax)" 
        #to make a list of values that don't repeat
    #for now this code was run, configured, and debugged using the answer that the code found after being run instead
    #i.e. I ran it, found the max number should be 0.64, and put the limiter there so the code will stop running once that point is found
